// A modern M2 ships as an MD21 chunked container: a leading MD21 header (4-byte tag + MD20 block size), the
// MD20 model block, then auxiliary chunks (SFID skin ids, TXID texture ids, ...). The Client loader reads
// only a self-contained MD20 whose textures name their files inline. This extracts the MD20 block and
// inlines the texture names the TXID chunk references by FileDataID, so the de-chunked image is what the
// downport then compacts onto the Client contract.
