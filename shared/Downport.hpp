/**
 * @brief Pre-parse orchestrator that reshapes a source MD20 image onto the client M2 contract.
 *
 * The header and body share the client's field layout, but a few records are wider in the source.
 * Each M2 theme's compaction (cameras / particles / ribbons / animations) slides them onto the
 * client strides and normalizes the source-only encodings, then the inner version is rewritten to
 * the client's. Most work is in place; only the synthesized texture-coordinate-combos array
 * (textures theme) appends two bytes, which grows the buffer.
 *
 * Allocation-agnostic: it never allocates. The caller owns the buffer (the model allocator in the
 * DLL, a std::vector in the host), so the same byte-transform compiles into both. The caller sizes
 * with WorkSize, copies the source bytes into its own buffer, then calls ProcessInPlace.
