// An emitter's record names a blend mode, which model construction maps through a fixed set of arms
// into a device blend state. Source content asks for a mode past the last arm, and the default arm
// resolves it to opaque with alpha testing left on -- a fire sprite drawn as a solid quad.
//
// What that mode actually means was recovered from the donor images: the version that introduced it
// added exactly one usable blend state alongside it, a screen blend -- incoming times what is NOT
// already there, added on top -- which brightens toward white without ever clipping. That state now
// exists here too, appended to the device's own tables, so the mode has a real home rather than a
// nearest-looking substitute.
//
// The correction is applied AFTER construction rather than by rewriting the record, so the model keeps
// the blend mode it was authored with. It has to be after, because the default arm and a genuine mode
// 0 leave the emitter in identical states -- only the record can still tell them apart, and the
// emitter's back-pointer to its own record is wired up during that same construction.
