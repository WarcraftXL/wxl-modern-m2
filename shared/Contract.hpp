/**
 * @brief Holds what every modern-M2 theme shares: the accepted source inner-version range and
 *        unaligned byte access into the pre-parse model buffer.
 *
 * The module teaches the client to read a modern M2 (the additive superset of the native model)
 * by reshaping it in memory at load time, never by pre-porting files. The work is split by M2
 * sub-system (cameras / particles / ribbons / animations / textures / skin / bones), each theme
 * owning its own deltas for every source version it supports.
