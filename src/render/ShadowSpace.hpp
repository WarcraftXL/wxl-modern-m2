/**
 * @brief Why a modern-M2 ground shadow rotates with the camera, measured at the draw that renders it.
 *
 * The shadow-map vertex program comes in three variants, selected by the shader-effect selector
 * (section->boneInfluences) clamped to 0..2. Only the variants for
 * boneInfluences >= 1 apply c14..c16 = inverse(cameraView) * lightView -- the rebase that cancels the
 * camera view carried by the c31 bone palette. The **boneInfluences == 0 variant goes straight from
 * the palette to the light projection**, so any section drawn through it is camera-locked by
 * construction: its shadow rotates rigidly with the camera, shape intact. That signature matches the
 * report exactly, whereas a merely stale palette would read as lag, not as rigid rotation.
 *
 * Modern skins do ship sections with boneInfluences == 0 (verified on disk: the ultratree's trunk).
 * Our live half is supposed to lift those to 1 at skin finalize (Skin.cpp, FixSubmeshes) BEFORE the
 * stock finalize memcpys the runtime section copy into the shared runtime object. This module checks
 * that guarantee where it actually matters -- at the draw -- and repairs it in place if it did not
 * hold, because several links in that chain (rebuild gating, hot-reshaped registry state, and the
 * per-instance override arrays at model+0x2D0 that the rebuild never touches) have never been
 * observed at runtime.
 *
 * The repair writes the RUNTIME section copy, never the model file.
