// A sequence whose keyframes are not stored in the model streams them from a companion file, and a
// modern companion file puts the very same flat track blob behind a one-chunk wrapper. Unwrapping is
// therefore the whole of the difference, and it belongs here rather than anywhere upstream of the
// read: the bytes are resident, nothing has looked at them yet, and the payload slides onto the
// buffer base the rebase already uses -- so the allocation the model owns keeps its identity and the
// only thing that changes is how many of its bytes count as the file.
//
// A file that is already flat is left exactly as it arrived.
//
// One shape stays out of reach: a model with an externalized skeleton splits the same companion file
// into separate event / attachment / bone chunks instead of one, which is a different unwrap and has
// no home while such models are refused at load.
