/**
 * @brief Masks the source blend time and remaps out-of-range sequence ids onto client ids.
 *
 * The source splits each sequence's blend time into in|out halves and ships a few sequence ids
 * above what the client engine resolves. This theme masks the blend time back to a single value and
 * remaps a curated id set to a client id, patching the sequence lookup so the engine still resolves them.
