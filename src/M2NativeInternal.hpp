// The reader is split by the load phases named in NativeLoad.cpp's MECHANISM banner -- demux (M2Demux),
// in-place field deltas + post-fixup injections (M2Fixups), the per-era record normalization
// (M2Normalize + the per-record rewrites, driven by the table in M2NormalizeLayout), then the
// offset->pointer walk that resolves the body itself (M2WalkOwned, driven by the record map in
// M2WalkLayout) -- all orchestrated by NativeLoad.cpp. The POD records the phases hand across (Scan from
// the demux, Outcome back to the caller) and the shared byte helpers live here; there is no shared
// MUTABLE state (the session counters are private to the orchestrator, fed from Outcome).
