/**
 * @brief Rebuilds the material / texunit contract a source skin omits, at skin finalize.
 *
 * A source skin encodes each batch's material in its own shaderId (packed blend-bit pair, or a modern effect
 * index) and leaves the header textureUnitLookup empty. The client's first shader-id pass indexes
 * textureUnitLookup[batch.textureCoordComboIndex] and the second texture binds only when the contract is
 * present. This runs at skin finalize, where the header and the pointer-fixed skin are live and before the
 * native passes size their parallel batch blocks: it decodes each batch's shaderId into the fixed-function
 * blend bits the client understands, synthesizes textureUnitLookup and textureCombinerCombos, parks LOD
 * submeshes, and clamps the render flags. Scoped to modern-M2-sourced content: its shaderId encoding is
 * source-specific, unlike the bone-budget split (BoneBudget.hpp) which applies to any client M2.
