/**
 * @brief Partitions any drawn submesh whose per-draw bone palette exceeds the client ceiling into
 *        sub-sections sized within the ceiling.
 *
 * The client vertex shader holds the bone palette from register 31, 3 registers per matrix, so
 * (256 - 31) / 3 = 75 bones per draw is the ceiling. This is a hard client-engine constraint on
 * the M2Header/M2SkinProfile client contract, not a modern-M2-source concern, so it applies
 * unconditionally at every skin finalize regardless of which pipeline produced the model (native,
 * a downported modern M2, or a client M2 another format baked, e.g. m3's M2Build). A greedy
 * triangle bin-packer splits each over-ceiling submesh into sub-sections, each with its own
 * compact boneCombos slice, deduplicated vertex block (bones[] remapped to the slice), and
 * global-indexed triangle block, rebuilding the live skin geometry arrays and header.boneCombos.
 * RepointBatchesAfterSplit re-points a model's EXISTING, already-valid batches across the run of
 * sub-sections their original submesh became; a caller that also needs to reinterpret batch
 * contents (e.g. a modern-M2 source's packed shaderId) does that re-pointing itself instead, using
 * the same SplitRun map.
